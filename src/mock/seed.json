You will begin with a solid review of modern Java and object-oriented programming, then learn how to build clean, modular REST APIs using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA and relational databases. From there, you will explore authentication, security, validation, error handling and testing so your services are ready for real production environments. In the second half of the course, you will connect these APIs to a React interface, manage state and routing on the frontend, and create a smooth end-to-end user experience. By completing multiple projects and a final capstone, you will be able to confidently design, implement and deploy full stack Java applications used in enterprise settings.",

From there, you will implement key supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression and decision trees using scikit-learn, while learning how to evaluate them with the right metrics and validation techniques. As you progress, you will work with feature engineering, model tuning and simple pipelines that mirror the workflows used by practicing ML engineers. The course wraps up with an end-to-end project where you choose a problem, build and compare models, and present your findings like you would in a real company setting. By the end, you will understand not just how to run ML code, but how to think like a machine learning practitioner.",
